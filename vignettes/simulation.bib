abstract = {We have investigated the reliability and reproducibility of HCV viral quasispecies quantification by ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) methods. Our study has been divided in two parts. First of all, by UDPS sequencing of clone mixes samples we have established the global noise level of UDPS and fine tuned a data treatment workflow previously optimized for HBV sequence analysis. Secondly, we have studied the reproducibility of the methodology by comparing 5 amplicons from two patient samples on three massive sequencing platforms (FLX+, FLX and Junior) after applying the error filters developed from the clonal/control study. After noise filtering the UDPS results, the three replicates showed the same 12 polymorphic sites above 0.7{\%}, with a mean CV of 4.86{\%}. Two polymorphic sites below 0.6{\%} were identified by two replicates and one replicate respectively. A total of 25, 23 and 26 haplotypes were detected by GS-Junior, GS-FLX and GS-FLX+. The observed CVs for the normalized Shannon entropy (Sn), the mutation frequency (Mf), and the nucleotidic diversity (Pi) were 1.46{\%}, 3.96{\%} and 3.78{\%}. The mean absolute difference in the two patients (5 amplicons each), in the GS-FLX and GS-FLX+, were 1.46{\%}, 3.96{\%} and 3.78{\%} for Sn, Mf and Pi. No false polymorphic site was observed above 0.5{\%}. Our results indicate that UDPS is an optimal alternative to molecular cloning for quantitative study of HCV viral quasispecies populations, both in complexity and composition. We propose an UDPS data treatment workflow for amplicons from the RNA viral quasispecies which, at a sequencing depth of at least 10,000 reads per strand, enables to obtain sequences and frequencies of consensus haplotypes above 0.5{\%} abundance with no erroneous mutations, with high confidence, resistant mutants as minor variants at the level of 1{\%}, with high confidence that variants are not missed, and highly confident measures of quasispecies complexity.},

abstract = {In this study, the reliability and reproducibility of viral quasispecies quantification by three ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) methods (FLX+, FLX, and Junior) were investigated and results compared with the conventional cloning technique. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was selected as the model. The pre- Core/Core region, the least overlapped HBV region, was analyzed in samples from a chronic hepatitis B patient by cloning and by UDPS. After computation filtering of the UDPS results, samples A1 and A2 (FLX+) and sample B (FLX) yielded the same 20 polymorphic positions. Junior yielded 18 polymorphic positions that coincided with the FLX results. In contrast, 50 polymorphic positions were detected by cloning. Quasispecies complexity plotted on graphs showed superimposed patterns and the quantitative parameters were similar between FLX+, FLX, Junior, and the cloning sequences. Twenty-two haplotypes were detected by Junior, and 37, 40, and 39 were detected by FLX A1, A2, and B, respectively. These differences may be attributable to methodological differences between FLX and Junior. By cloning, 47 haplotypes were detected. Eight clones with insertions and deletions that induced de novo stop codons were not observed by UDPS because the UDPS filter discarded them. Our results indicate that UDPS is an optimal alternative to molecular cloning for quantitative study of the viral quasispecies. Nonetheless, specific mutations, such as insertions and deletions, were only detected by cloning. A filter should be designed to analyze cloning sequences, and UDPS filters should be improved to include the specific mutations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mutant spectrum dynamics (changes in the related mutants that compose viral populations) has a decisive impact on virus behavior. The several platforms of next generation sequencing (NGS) to study viral quasispecies offer a magnifying glass to study viral quasispecies complexity. Several parameters are available to quantify the complexity of mutant spectra, but they have limitations. Here we critically evaluate the information provided by several population diversity indices, and we propose the introduction of some new ones used in ecology. In particular we make a distinction between incidence, abundance and function measures of viral quasispecies composition. We suggest a multidimensional approach (complementary information contributed by adequately chosen indices), propose some guidelines, and illustrate the use of indices with a simple example. We apply the indices to three clinical samples of hepatitis C virus that display different population heterogeneity. Areas of virus biology in which population complexity plays a role are discussed.},

abstract = {Given the inherent dynamics of a viral quasispecies, we are often interested in the comparison of diversity indices of sequential samples of a patient, or in the comparison of diversity indices of virus in groups of patients in a treated versus control design. It is then important to make sure that the diversity measures from each sample may be compared with no bias and within a consistent statistical framework. In the present report, we review some indices often used as measures for viral quasispecies complexity and provide means for statistical inference, applying procedures taken from the ecology field. In particular, we examine the Shannon entropy and the mutation frequency, and we discuss the appropriateness of different normalization methods of the Shannon entropy found in the literature. By taking amplicons ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) raw data as a surrogate of a real hepatitis C virus viral population, we study through in-silico sampling the statistical properties of these indices under two methods of viral quasispecies sampling, classical cloning followed by Sanger sequencing (CCSS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as UDPS. We propose solutions specific to each of the two sampling methods-CCSS and NGS-to guarantee statistically conforming conclusions as free of bias as possible.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: josep.gregori@gmail.com SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
